# Garcia's Bar and Grill: Case Study

Garcia's came to me in 2020 when COVID regulations were starting to come into effect. They wanted a website that could show customers the menu so they didn't have to explain it over the phone. Their timetable? As soon as possible! Within two weeks, I had made a fully custom web app that met their needs, and was within their budget. They were thrilled and ever since then just started calling me for things. Thats how I got the unique opportunity to do things like graphic design and advertising.

## Some of My Work

This is a file that contains some of my favorite work I have done for Garcia's. The file is broken up into five main categories:

### 1. Website

I provided five screenshots of the Garcia's that I am going to publish soon. 

### 2. Menu 

We have had a couple of menus, but I provided the two most recent ones for each location. I also provided a `COVID Menu`. This design was requested to be this way because they needed a way to feature their most selling dishes, but in a way that could be thrown away. If you remember during COVID, restaurants all used disposable menus.

### 3. Table Tents

I assume familiarity with a table tent, but these would sit inside of those acrylic things and be displayed to the customer. We would frequently create and change these, but we generally stuck to a similar style.

### 4. Social Media

Sometimes I would have to create media to go along with a post, and so I attached some of my favorites that I have done.

### 5. Photography

I'm not a photographer by trade, but I have had to learn things while performing this unique role with Garcia's. I attached some of my favorite pictures that I took for their various media. I used some of these pictures frequently on social media and things like the table tents.
